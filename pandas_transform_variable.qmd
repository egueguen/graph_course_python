# Imports

```{python}
import pandas as pd
pd.options.mode.copy_on_write = True
```

# Dataset


```{python}
counties = pd.read_csv("Week_06/Prework/us_counties_data.csv")
```


```{python}
area_df = counties[["county", "area_sq_miles","pop_20"]]
area_df
```

# Creating New Variables

```{python}
# New variable with area in sq km
area_df["area_sq_km"] = area_df["area_sq_miles"] * 2.59

# New variable area in hectares
area_df["area_hectares"] = area_df["area_sq_km"] * 100

area_df
```

## Practice: Area in Acres

Using the `area_df` dataset, create a new column called `area_acres`by multiplying the `area_sq_miles` variable by 640. Score the result back into `area_df` and display the dataframe.

```{python}
# Practice code:
area_df["area_acres"] = area_df["area_sq_miles"] * 640

area_df
```

# Modifying Existing Variables

```{python}
area_df["area_sq_km"] = area_df["area_sq_km"].round(2)

area_df
```

## Practice: Rounding `area_acres`

Using the area_df dataset, round the area_acres variable to one decimal place. Update the DataFrame area_df and display it.

```{python}
# Practice code:
area_df["area_acres"] = area_df["area_acres"].round(1)

area_df
```

# Calculating with Multiple Variables

```{python}
area_df["pop_per_sq_km"] = (area_df["pop_20"] / area_df["area_sq_km"]).round(1)

area_df = area_df.sort_values(by="pop_per_sq_km", ascending=False)

area_df
```

## Practice: Calculate Foreign-Born Percentage

Use the `counties` dataset to calculate the percentage of foreign-born residents in each county. The variable `foreign_born_num` shows the number of foreign-born residents and `pop_20` shows the total population. Sort the DataFrame in descending order of the percentage of foreign-born residents. 

```{python}
# Practice code:
foreign_df = counties[["county", "foreign_born_num","pop_20"]]
# Percentage of foreign-born residents
foreign_df["fb_percent"] = (foreign_df["foreign_born_num"] / foreign_df["pop_20"]) * 100

foreign_df = foreign_df.sort_values(by="fb_percent", ascending=False)

foreign_df
```

Which two counties have the highest percentage of foreign-born residents?

Miami-Dade, FL and Queens, NY

# Creating Boolean Variables

```{python}
changes_df = counties[["county", "pop_change_2010_2020", "pct_emp_change_2010_2021"]]
changes_df
```

```{python}
changes_df["pop_increase"] = changes_df["pop_change_2010_2020"] > 0
changes_df["emp_increase"] = changes_df["pct_emp_change_2010_2021"] > 0
changes_df
```

```{python}
# Counties where population increased but employment decreased
pop_up_emp_down = changes_df.query("pop_increase == True & emp_increase == False")
pop_up_emp_down
```

```{python}
# Counties where population increased but employment decreased
pop_up_emp_down = changes_df.query("pop_increase & ~(emp_increase)")
pop_up_emp_down
```

## Practice: Categorize Counties by Foreign-Born Population

In a previous practice question, we calculated the percentage of foreign-born residents in each county. Now, create a Boolean variable foreign_born_pct_gt_30 that is True if the percentage is greater than 30%.

When youâ€™re done, query the DataFrame to show only counties where foreign_born_pct_gt_30 is True. You should get 24 rows.


```{python}
# Practice code:
foreign_df["foreign_born_pct_gt_30"] = foreign_df["fb_percent"] > 30

foreign_df.query("foreign_born_pct_gt_30")
foreign_df.query("foreign_born_pct_gt_30").shape
```

# Copy on Write Warning


```{python}
pd.options.mode.copy_on_write = False

counties_mini = counties[["county", "area_sq_miles"]]

counties_mini["area_sq_miles"] = counties_mini["area_sq_miles"].round(2)

counties_mini
```
