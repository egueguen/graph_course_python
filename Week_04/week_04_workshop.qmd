# Dataset

## Description

The India TB Pathways dataset is based on a study conducted in Vellore district, Tamil Nadu, India. It examines the pre-diagnostic costs and health-seeking behavior of 880 new adult pulmonary tuberculosis
patients registered at Primary Health Centres (PHCs).


```{python}
data_tb = pd.read_csv("/Users/emiliegueguen/Desktop/GraphCourses2025/Week_04/Data/india_tb_pathways_and_costs.csv")
show(data_tb)
```

# Graphical Representation

```{python}
px.histogram(data_tb, x="Form of TB",color = "Sex",
title = "Relationship between Gender and Form of TB", text_auto=True,
labels = {"Form of TB":"Form of Tuberculosis","Sex":"Gender"})
```

```{python}
max_age = int(data_tb.Age.max())
min_age = int(data_tb.Age.min())
common_gender = data_tb.Sex.mode()[0]
common_tb_form = data_tb["Form of TB"].mode()[0]
```


**Interpretation**

Tuberculosis (TB) is more present in **`{python} common_gender`** than female. The TB form *`{python} common_tb_form`* is less abundant in the overall population than the TB form *Ini smear +*. 


**Population age**

- minimun : `{python} min_age` years
- maximum : `{python} max_age` years

**Education**

```{python}
education = data_tb.Education.mode()[0]
nb = data_tb.Education.value_counts()
nb_educ = int(nb["No Education"])
```

In the study population, `{python} nb_educ` have `{python} education`.
